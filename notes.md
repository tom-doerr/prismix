## Notes for LLMs

### Pylint Crash
- Pylint encountered a fatal error while checking `tests/test_main.py`. Please open an issue in the bug tracker using the pre-filled template located at `/home/tom/.cache/pylint/pylint-crash-2024-12-17-01-31-52.txt`.
- The error is related to `isort` and its compatibility with the current version of Pylint. The traceback indicates that `isort.SortImports` is not found, which suggests a version mismatch or a missing dependency.

### Pytest Issues
- Pytest failed to run `tests/test_file_editor_module.py` due to an `ImportError`. The error message indicates that `FileEditorModule` could not be imported from `prismix.core.file_editor_module`. This could be due to a missing or incorrect import statement, or a circular dependency issue.

### Action Items
1. **Fix Pytest ImportError**:
   - Verify the import statement in `tests/test_file_editor_module.py`. Ensure that `FileEditorModule` is correctly defined and accessible.
   - Check for circular dependencies in the `prismix.core` module.
   - If necessary, refactor the code to avoid circular imports.

2. **Address Pylint Warnings**:
   - Fix the `C0301` (line too long) warnings by breaking long lines into multiple shorter lines.
   - Move the import statement `from prismix.main import execute_instruction` to the top of the module to resolve the `C0413` (wrong-import-position) warning.
   - Add docstrings to the functions in `tests/test_main.py` to address the `C0116` (missing-function-docstring) warnings.

### Additional Notes
- The `PydanticDeprecatedSince20` warning indicates that the code is using deprecated features from Pydantic. Consider updating the code to use the new `ConfigDict` approach as suggested in the warning.
- The `DeprecationWarning` from `litellm` regarding `open_text` should be addressed by migrating to the new `files()` API as recommended.
### Pylint Warning
- The `tests/test_metrics.py` file contains a redundant string statement that has no effect, causing a `W0105` warning. This has been resolved by removing the unnecessary string statement.

### Pydantic Deprecation
- The code is using deprecated features from Pydantic. The code has been updated to use the new `ConfigDict` approach to avoid future issues.

### litellm Deprecation
- The `litellm` library is using deprecated `open_text` API. The code has been migrated to the new `files()` API to avoid future deprecation warnings.
